## Main Objective

<p> Our aim is to create a mobile application that leverages patient information to provide accurate predictions and informative details about kidney health. Additionally, we aim to provide users with personalized, kidney-friendly diet plans. We plan to complement the app with an IoT device to test the quality of drinking water, a significant factor in kidney disease. Our goal is to improve the lives of kidney patients by providing them with accessible and actionable health information. </p>

## Main Research Questions

- How can machine learning and image processing be used to accurately identify patients with chronic kidney disease (CKD) in Sri Lanka?
- How can these technologies be leveraged to develop personalized diet plans that effectively manage CKD in Sri Lanka?
- How can an Internet of Things (IoT) device be used to measure and analyze water quality in Sri Lanka, and what are the potential implications for CKD risk factors?
- How can the data generated by these technologies be integrated to inform population-level CKD prevention and management strategies in Sri Lanka?
